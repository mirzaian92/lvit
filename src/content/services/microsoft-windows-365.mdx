## When Windows 365 is a good fit

Windows 365 works best when you need consistent desktop access without relying on a specific physical device. It is often used for:

- Secure access for contractors or temporary staff
- Shared device environments where local data should not persist
- Teams that move between locations and need the same desktop each time

## Where this matters in Las Vegas

Las Vegas operations often involve flexible staffing and multiple sites. Cloud PCs can reduce onsite device churn while keeping access consistent.

We plan for:

- Sign-in control, MFA enforcement, and device compliance expectations
- Connectivity constraints at different sites and on mobile networks
- Peripheral needs like printing and scanner workflows in real environments

## Common mistakes

- Sizing Cloud PCs based on guesses instead of actual app needs
- Skipping identity hardening, which undermines the point of Cloud PCs
- Not planning data location, storage expectations, and user workflows
- Rolling out broadly before validating printing and line-of-business apps

## What good looks like

Good Windows 365 outcomes look like:

- Users can sign in securely from multiple devices without confusion
- Applications behave consistently and are documented for support
- Access is tied to roles and can be removed quickly when needed
- The environment is manageable without creating extra admin overhead

## FAQs

### Is Windows 365 the same as Azure Virtual Desktop?

They are related but not identical. Windows 365 is simpler for many teams. Azure Virtual Desktop offers more flexibility. We help choose based on requirements, not buzzwords.

### Can you use Windows 365 with Microsoft 365 security controls?

Yes. Identity and conditional access are core. We plan policies so Cloud PCs fit into your overall device and access strategy.

### Does this replace laptops?

Sometimes. Many teams still use laptops for mobility while running Cloud PCs for standardization. The right answer depends on workload, network reliability, and user roles.
