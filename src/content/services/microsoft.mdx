## How to use this Microsoft hub

This page is a starting point. If your needs are specific, jump into the dedicated pages for Microsoft 365 security and administration, Office 365 migrations, Azure, and Windows 365.

## Where this matters in Las Vegas

Las Vegas organizations frequently have a mix of customer-facing operations, multiple locations, and vendors who need access. Microsoft identity and collaboration settings control a large part of your risk and your day-to-day support volume.

Local realities we plan for:

- Staff changes that require fast, auditable onboarding and offboarding
- Users working across devices and locations, with consistent sign-in controls
- Secure file sharing with external vendors and clients
- After-hours access requirements without over-privileging accounts

## Common mistakes

- Treating Microsoft 365 like email only, then skipping identity hardening
- Using global admin for daily work, creating unnecessary risk
- Allowing uncontrolled file sharing, then trying to clean it up after the fact
- Migrating mailboxes without planning for permissions, archives, and mobile devices

## What good looks like

You should be able to:

- Enforce MFA and block risky sign-in patterns with conditional access
- Standardize user setup with groups, licensing rules, and named admin roles
- Control external sharing with clear defaults and audit visibility
- Restore or recover from mailbox and file mistakes with a tested approach

## What we typically help with

- Microsoft 365 tenant configuration and security baselines
- Exchange, OneDrive, and SharePoint administration tied to real workflows
- Azure identity, access, and cloud architecture support
- Windows 365 Cloud PC strategy, rollout, and lifecycle management

## FAQs

### Do you support both Microsoft 365 and Office 365?

Yes. Many teams still use the Office 365 term. We treat it as the user-facing productivity experience, while Microsoft 365 also includes security and device management controls.

### Can you help reduce Microsoft 365 licensing confusion?

We can help map licenses to roles and required features. We avoid overspecifying and focus on matching requirements to operational reality.

### Do you manage Intune and device compliance?

Yes. Device compliance and conditional access usually go together. We can help build a policy set that is enforceable without breaking common workflows.
