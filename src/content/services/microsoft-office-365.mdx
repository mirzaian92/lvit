## When Office 365 is the right move

Many businesses start with email as the entry point, then expand into SharePoint, Teams, and identity controls. Office 365 work often includes:

- Exchange Online mailbox migration or rebuild
- Shared mailbox and delegation planning
- Mobile device reconfiguration and profile cleanup
- DNS changes and mail flow validation

## Where this matters in Las Vegas

Cutovers in Las Vegas are often tied to operational windows, not ideal IT windows. That means migration planning needs to account for:

- After-hours work to avoid front-of-house downtime
- Multiple locations with different connectivity and device types
- Seasonal staff changes that affect licensing and mail routing

## Common mistakes

- Migrating mailboxes before documenting permissions and shared mailbox use
- Skipping pilot users, then discovering device and authentication issues late
- Not planning for line-of-business systems that send email via SMTP
- Treating the cutover as a single moment without a rollback path

## What good looks like

An Office 365 project is in good shape when:

- Pilot users are successful across desktop and mobile
- Shared mailboxes and calendars behave the same or better after the move
- Mail flow is verified with real sender types and business systems
- Support is staffed for the first days after cutover

## FAQs

### Do you migrate archives and shared mailboxes?

Yes. We plan mailbox scope, retention requirements, and the user experience for shared mailboxes before moving data.

### Can you migrate from Google Workspace?

Yes. The biggest risks are identity, permissions, and user training on new workflows. We plan those alongside data migration.

### How long does a migration take?

Timing depends on mailbox size, number of users, and cutover method. We avoid promising a calendar date until we validate constraints and pilot results.
