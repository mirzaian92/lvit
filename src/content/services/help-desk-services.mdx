## What a good help desk does differently

Help desk support is not only answering tickets. It is triage, categorization, and escalation that results in closed loops. Over time, the same issues should happen less often because root causes are addressed.

Typical help desk coverage includes:

- User support for Microsoft 365, devices, printers, and connectivity
- Access requests with audit-friendly approvals
- Onboarding and offboarding execution
- Escalation to network, cloud, or security engineering when needed

## Where this matters in Las Vegas

Las Vegas environments often have mixed schedules, front-of-house devices, and multi-location constraints. That changes support planning:

- After-hours events can create urgent access and connectivity needs
- Shared workstations require clear standards and faster resets
- Onsite coordination is sometimes required for cabling, access points, or device swaps

## Common mistakes

- Tickets without context, leading to slower resolution and repeated back-and-forth
- No standard software set, so every device becomes a unique snowflake
- Escalation paths that are unclear, so issues stall between teams
- No reporting on repeat issues, so nothing gets improved

## What good looks like

You should see:

- Consistent ticket categories that reflect business impact
- Resolution notes that help the next technician and your internal team
- A short list each month of the top repeat issues and the fix plan
- Predictable onboarding and offboarding execution

## FAQs

### Do you offer onsite support for help desk issues?

Yes, when onsite reduces downtime or when physical changes are required. Most issues are handled remotely, with onsite reserved for device swaps, cabling, or access point work.

### Can users call instead of creating tickets?

Yes. We support multiple intake methods. The key is capturing enough detail in the ticket so the work remains trackable and reportable.

### How do you handle password and MFA issues?

Identity recovery is a common pain point. We standardize the reset process and ensure it is secure, auditable, and fast for legitimate users.
