## What VoIP support includes

VoIP projects touch networking, security, and user workflow. Support commonly includes:

- Network assessment for latency, jitter, and QoS readiness
- Firewall and SIP-related configuration planning where applicable
- User and extension provisioning with role-based administration
- Call flow planning for departments, locations, and after-hours routing

## Where this matters in Las Vegas

Las Vegas businesses often have customer-facing call patterns, multiple sites, and extended hours. VoIP planning should account for:

- Front desk and reception reliability during peak traffic periods
- After-hours routing that reaches the right person without exposing everyone
- Failover behavior when an ISP has an outage at one location

## Common mistakes

- Implementing VoIP without validating network readiness first
- Ignoring Wi-Fi coverage and cabling limitations for handsets
- Making everyone an admin, then losing control of changes
- Not documenting call flows, which slows down future changes

## What good looks like

VoIP is in good shape when:

- Call quality is measurable and consistent at each site
- Call flows match how teams actually route work
- Administration is role-based and documented
- Failover and outage behavior is tested and understood

## FAQs

### Do you replace the phone carrier?

We can support carrier selection and implementation, but we focus on making the technical setup reliable. Carrier choice depends on features, contracts, and your call patterns.

### Can you integrate VoIP with Microsoft Teams?

Yes, in many cases. Integration depends on provider capabilities and your licensing. We plan around user workflows and reliability.

### Do you support analog lines and fax?

Sometimes. Legacy requirements exist in healthcare and certain industries. We plan for them explicitly so they do not become last-minute blockers.
