## What ongoing AI ownership looks like

If AI becomes part of daily operations, it needs ownership like any other business system. As an AI managed service provider, we focus on:

- Admin and access governance for approved AI tools
- Integration planning that respects identity and data boundaries
- Usage review and continuous improvement based on real workflows
- Support processes for staff questions and safe enablement

## Where this matters in Las Vegas

Many Las Vegas teams run lean. AI tools can help, but unmanaged adoption creates risk quickly, especially with vendor access and staff turnover.

We plan for:

- Onboarding and offboarding that includes AI tool access and policy reminders
- Standard prompts and templates for repeatable, reviewable output
- Security controls that align with Microsoft 365 and endpoint standards

## Common mistakes

- One person setting up AI tools with no documentation or admin continuity
- No review standards for AI output, leading to quality and compliance issues
- Allowing integrations without understanding where data is stored or retained
- Treating AI policy as "common sense" instead of written rules with examples

## What good looks like

AI support is in a good place when:

- Approved tools and integrations are documented with ownership
- Users have guidelines that reduce risk and improve output quality
- Access and usage can be audited and changed quickly
- AI workflows are tied to business outcomes, not experimentation alone

## FAQs

### Can this include Microsoft Copilot planning?

Yes. We can help evaluate readiness, licensing impacts, data governance, and secure deployment patterns within Microsoft environments.

### Can you support multiple departments differently?

Yes. Sales, operations, and finance often have different acceptable uses. We prefer department-specific examples so the policy is actionable.

### Do you provide training?

We provide practical enablement tied to your approved tools and your data handling expectations. We avoid generic training that does not match your environment.
