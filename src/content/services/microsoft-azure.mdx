## What we support in Azure

Azure work should start with identity and governance, then expand into workload operations. Common support areas:

- Entra ID (Azure AD) roles, access reviews, and conditional access
- Secure connectivity patterns for branch offices and remote users
- Subscription structure, tagging, and cost visibility basics
- Backup and recovery planning for cloud and hybrid workloads

## Where this matters in Las Vegas

Las Vegas organizations often run mixed environments: on-prem systems that still matter, plus cloud apps that keep growing. Azure is usually the bridge between those worlds.

We plan for:

- Multi-site connectivity and secure remote access
- Vendor access patterns for hosted systems and support
- After-hours troubleshooting when a workload impact is customer-facing

## Common mistakes

- Deploying workloads before defining admin roles and change control
- Treating networking as an afterthought, then fighting reliability problems
- Skipping logging and retention, making investigations harder later
- Mixing production and test resources with no separation

## What good looks like

Azure is healthier when:

- Identity controls are enforced and documented
- Network paths are clear, secure, and monitored
- Workloads have ownership, backup expectations, and recovery procedures
- Changes are logged and reviewed so drift is visible

## FAQs

### Do you support hybrid environments?

Yes. Many businesses keep some systems local while moving others into Azure. Hybrid planning is common and often the best path for continuity.

### Can you help with Azure cost surprises?

We can set guardrails, tagging, and basic reporting to reduce unexpected spend. We avoid promising specific savings without observing actual usage patterns.

### Is Azure only for large organizations?

No. Azure can be a good fit for smaller teams when it reduces maintenance overhead and improves resilience, as long as governance is simple and consistent.
