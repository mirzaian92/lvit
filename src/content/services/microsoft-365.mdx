## What Microsoft 365 support includes

Microsoft 365 support typically includes tenant administration plus the guardrails that keep identity and collaboration secure:

- User lifecycle: onboarding, offboarding, and role-based access
- MFA enforcement and conditional access policies
- Secure mail flow, anti-phishing settings, and safer sharing defaults
- Device compliance integrations when you use Intune or similar tooling

## Where this matters in Las Vegas

Las Vegas organizations often rely on vendors, seasonal staffing, and off-hours work. Microsoft 365 is usually where those access patterns show up first.

We pay extra attention to:

- Contractor access duration and restrictions
- Shared devices and sign-in session controls
- Privileged roles and admin account separation
- External sharing policies that match real client and vendor workflows

## Common mistakes

- Enabling MFA but leaving risky sign-in paths open
- Using one admin account for everything, then losing audit clarity
- Allowing external sharing everywhere, instead of defining a safe default
- Ignoring mailbox forwarding rules and OAuth app consent risk

## What good looks like

Good Microsoft 365 operations look like:

- Consistent licensing and group strategy tied to job roles
- Clear admin roles with least privilege and strong authentication
- Conditional access policies that are tested and documented
- Security reporting that explains what changed and why it matters

## FAQs

### Can you help with Microsoft 365 incident response?

Yes. Identity and email events are common in business incidents. We can help with containment, audit review, and policy hardening after the initial issue is controlled.

### Do you support SharePoint and OneDrive governance?

Yes. We can help define team site patterns, sharing defaults, retention expectations, and a support model that users can follow.

### Can you migrate from an older tenant?

Yes. Tenant-to-tenant or domain changes require careful planning around identities, devices, and dependencies. We plan for those before moving data.
