## Why IT disposition is a security topic

Old laptops, servers, and drives often contain sensitive data even when they are not in active use. A controlled IT disposition process helps:

- Reduce data exposure risk
- Track what was retired and when
- Standardize device lifecycle planning
- Support compliance expectations where applicable

## Where this matters in Las Vegas

Las Vegas organizations often have multiple locations and mixed device ownership patterns. Devices can end up in storage closets, back offices, or offsite. A disposition plan reduces drift and uncertainty.

We typically build:

- Asset check-in workflows for retired devices
- Identity and access cleanup tied to device retirement
- Documentation that matches your internal audit needs

## Common mistakes

- Storing retired devices indefinitely with no tracking
- Wiping without documenting what was wiped and how
- Forgetting to remove devices from management tools and access systems
- Treating disposal as a one-time event instead of a lifecycle process

## What good looks like

Good disposition processes look like:

- An asset list with owner, status, and retirement date
- A secure wipe process tied to device type and storage media
- Documentation that supports internal and external audits
- Lifecycle planning that reduces surprise hardware failures

## FAQs

### Do you handle hard drives from servers and NAS devices?

We can help build a process for secure handling and documentation. Device-specific requirements vary, so we plan the method around data sensitivity and operational constraints.

### Can you coordinate pickup for multiple locations?

Yes. Multi-location coordination is common. We plan for onsite access and labeling so assets do not get lost in transit.

### Is this the same as hardware refresh planning?

It is related. Disposition is the end of the lifecycle. Refresh planning is the beginning. We prefer to connect them so standards remain consistent.
