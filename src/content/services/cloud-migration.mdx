## The migration problems that cause real downtime

Most migration pain comes from dependencies that were not visible:

- Identity and authentication changes that break apps
- DNS, SMTP, and vendor integrations that stop working post-cutover
- Permissions and file access models that change unexpectedly
- Network path assumptions that fail in a multi-location environment

## Where this matters in Las Vegas

Las Vegas operations often have fixed windows for change. A migration plan should respect peak business periods and after-hours access constraints.

We plan:

- Pilot users and pilot workloads that represent real usage patterns
- Cutover sequencing that keeps critical operations online
- Support coverage for the first days after major changes

## Common mistakes

- Migrating without a complete list of dependencies and owner contacts
- Not defining success criteria and rollback triggers in advance
- Treating migration as a one-time event instead of a staged transition
- Skipping documentation updates, leaving support teams blind later

## What good looks like

A strong migration looks like:

- Clear scope with agreed exclusions and assumptions
- Pilot validation that includes edge cases like mobile and printing
- A cutover runbook with timings, owners, and validation steps
- Post-move stabilization with a short list of remaining risks

## FAQs

### Can you migrate one app at a time?

Yes. Phased migrations often reduce risk and help teams adjust. We choose phases based on dependencies and business impact.

### Do you handle user training?

We can provide practical guidance and workflow-specific changes. Training works best when tied to the exact tools users will see.

### What happens after the migration?

We move into stabilization: monitoring, documentation updates, and fixing the small but important issues that appear after real usage begins.
