## What cloud services include

Cloud services cover the planning and operations needed to run cloud workloads safely:

- Identity and access design for cloud apps and cloud resources
- Connectivity patterns between locations, users, and cloud services
- Monitoring, logging, and change control that prevents drift
- Backups and recovery for systems that still have failure modes

## Where this matters in Las Vegas

Las Vegas businesses often have a hybrid reality. Some systems must remain onsite, while collaboration and certain applications are cloud-first. Cloud services need to respect:

- Multi-site connectivity and consistent access controls
- Vendor access, especially for industry-specific applications
- After-hours operational windows that require fast response

## Common mistakes

- Moving workloads without defining ownership and admin roles
- Treating cloud as "set it and forget it" and skipping monitoring
- Not documenting dependencies, then being surprised during outages
- Creating inconsistent access patterns that are hard to secure

## What good looks like

Cloud operations are in a good state when:

- Access is role-based and reviewed, with strong authentication
- Changes are logged, approved, and recoverable
- Monitoring and alerting are tuned to meaningful business impact
- Hybrid connections are stable and documented

## FAQs

### Do you support hybrid environments?

Yes. Hybrid is common. We plan identity, connectivity, and support standards so users have a consistent experience across cloud and onsite systems.

### Can cloud reduce onsite support needs?

Sometimes. Cloud can reduce hardware maintenance, but it still requires ownership of identity, configuration, and security baselines.

### Do you manage cloud backups?

Yes, when the workload requires it. We align backup and recovery expectations to the systems that drive business operations.
