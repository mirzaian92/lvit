## What managed IT covers day to day

Managed IT is the combination of people, process, and tooling that keeps your environment stable between projects. In practical terms, that usually means:

- Identity and access management for staff changes and vendor access
- Endpoint standards, patching, and device lifecycle management
- Network monitoring and change control for switches, firewalls, and Wi-Fi
- Microsoft 365 administration and security settings that stay consistent
- Backup verification and disaster recovery runbooks that get tested
- Help desk support with ticket categorization that shows patterns, not noise

## Where this matters in Las Vegas

Las Vegas businesses often run beyond normal office hours and across multiple sites. That changes what "managed" needs to mean. A good plan accounts for after-hours access, onsite entry rules, and when a tech needs to be physically present instead of remote.

Examples we plan for locally:

- Multi-tenant buildings where escort requirements affect onsite response
- Retail and service businesses that cannot have downtime during peak traffic windows
- Hybrid teams that still need consistent endpoint control even when users are offsite

## Common mistakes

Teams usually do not fail because they do not care. They fail because ownership is unclear or because standards are not enforced.

- Mixing admin accounts with daily-use accounts, then losing track of privileges
- Treating backups as a checkbox instead of a measurable recovery capability
- Letting "one-off exceptions" become the default configuration over time
- Buying tools without assigning who actually owns alerts, tuning, and response

## What good looks like

You should be able to answer these questions without a long meeting:

- Which devices are supported, and which are out of standard
- Who has elevated access, why they have it, and how it is reviewed
- What changed in the last 30 days and which changes were approved
- How quickly a lost laptop can be disabled and recovered from
- Whether backups can restore a specific system within a defined window

## How we start

The first phase is about truth, not opinions. We document current state, decide what "standard" means, and then close the obvious gaps in an order that reduces risk while improving support speed.

1. Inventory endpoints, identity, SaaS, and critical systems
2. Define a standard device build and baseline security controls
3. Normalize help desk intake and assign ownership for recurring problems
4. Build a realistic continuity plan with tested recovery steps

## FAQs

### Is managed IT the same as remote help desk?

Help desk is part of it. Managed IT includes ownership of standards, security baselines, monitoring, and ongoing improvement so the help desk gets faster over time.

### Can we keep an internal IT person?

Yes. Many organizations keep internal IT and use a managed provider for escalation, coverage, and standards. A co-managed model can be a better fit when you want hands-on control.

### Do you support onsite in the valley?

Onsite is planned and scheduled based on location, building rules, and urgency. The goal is to solve most issues remotely and use onsite when it truly reduces downtime.

### How do you handle after-hours issues?

We design triage and escalation based on business impact. After-hours coverage matters most when your operations or customer flow extend beyond typical office schedules.
