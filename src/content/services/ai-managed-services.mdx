## What AI managed services focus on

Most AI problems are not model problems. They are data, identity, and workflow problems. AI managed services typically include:

- An AI usage policy tied to your data classification and risk tolerance
- Identity and access controls for AI tools and integrations
- Workflow guidance: where AI saves time without creating quality issues
- Logging and review processes for sensitive use cases

## Where this matters in Las Vegas

Las Vegas businesses often have customer-facing operations and regulated workflows in healthcare and insurance. That makes it important to define what data can be used with which tools.

Common local scenarios:

- Marketing teams using AI for content and analysis while protecting client data
- Front-office staff using AI-assisted templates without exposing private information
- Leadership using AI summaries while preserving retention and audit expectations

## Common mistakes

- Allowing any AI tool without deciding what data is allowed
- Copying sensitive text into third-party tools with no policy or oversight
- Treating AI output as authoritative without review standards
- Skipping identity management, leading to shadow accounts and poor offboarding

## What good looks like

You should see:

- A clear policy that staff can follow without guesswork
- Approved tools with named owners and admin control
- Training that includes examples of acceptable and unacceptable use
- Integration decisions that align with Microsoft 365 and security controls

## FAQs

### Do you build custom models?

We focus on enabling safe, operational AI use and governance. Custom model development is a separate discipline and is not required for most businesses.

### Can AI be used in regulated workflows?

Sometimes. The key is data handling, access control, and documented review. We help you evaluate feasibility and set guardrails.

### Does AI replace help desk or security work?

AI can speed up certain tasks, but it does not replace ownership. We treat it as an augmentation tool within a documented process.
