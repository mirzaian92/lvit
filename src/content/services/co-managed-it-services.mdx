## Who co-managed IT is for

Co-managed IT fits when you have internal IT ownership but need additional bandwidth or depth. Common reasons:

- A single IT person cannot cover vacations, after-hours, and projects
- You want a second set of eyes on security and continuity controls
- You need help desk coverage while internal IT stays focused on systems

## Where this matters in Las Vegas

Las Vegas operations can change quickly: new locations, seasonal staffing, and vendor-driven change windows. Co-managed setups work best when responsibilities are explicit, so issues do not bounce between teams.

We often design co-managed coverage around:

- Onsite coordination rules for multi-tenant buildings
- After-hours escalation for customer-facing operations
- Standard device and access controls across multiple sites

## Common mistakes

- No written division of responsibilities, then nobody owns a problem
- Shared admin credentials instead of named, audited roles
- Competing tools that duplicate monitoring and create confusion
- Ticketing split across systems with no single source of truth

## What good looks like

Co-managed IT works when:

- Internal IT owns strategy and business applications
- The MSP owns monitoring, baseline enforcement, and escalation
- Both sides share a standard for documentation and change control
- Reporting highlights repeat issues and the plan to eliminate them

## How we structure responsibilities

We document ownership by category: identity, endpoints, networks, Microsoft 365, backups, and vendor access. Then we define what qualifies as escalation and the response expectations for each class of incident.

## FAQs

### Will we lose control of our environment?

No. Co-managed is built around shared control. The key is using named accounts, clear ownership, and change approval rules so control is auditable.

### Can you work in our existing tools?

Often yes. We evaluate what you have, identify gaps, and decide what needs to change to keep operations reliable.

### Do you support internal IT with after-hours coverage?

Yes. After-hours coverage is a common reason teams adopt co-managed support in Las Vegas, especially when operations extend beyond normal schedules.
