## A practical definition of cybersecurity for MSP clients

Cybersecurity is not one tool. It is a set of decisions that keep identity, endpoints, and data protected while still letting people do their jobs. For most Las Vegas businesses, the fastest gains come from getting a few fundamentals right and keeping them consistent.

Core areas we typically address:

- Identity: MFA, conditional access, and admin role hygiene
- Endpoints: patching, EDR, encryption, and local admin control
- Email and collaboration: phishing resilience and safer sharing defaults
- Backups and recovery: recovery capability, not just backup jobs
- Monitoring and response: clear ownership for alerts and escalation

## Where this matters in Las Vegas

Las Vegas has a mix of hospitality, healthcare, professional services, and multi-site operations. That creates a predictable set of risks:

- High turnover periods that increase account and access cleanup needs
- Vendor and contractor access that stays open longer than intended
- Shared devices at front desks, shop floors, or service counters
- After-hours operations that require incident response outside of 9 to 5

Security planning has to match those realities. Otherwise, teams work around controls and the gaps get wider.

## Common mistakes

These are patterns that repeatedly lead to avoidable incidents:

- MFA enabled but not enforced for legacy protocols or privileged roles
- Backups configured without proof of restore, then failing in the moment
- Too many admin accounts, with no review cadence and no separation of duties
- Relying on email filtering alone, without user and access controls
- Treating "security awareness training" as the only anti-phishing control

## What good looks like

Good security is visible in the operations:

- A new hire gets the right access quickly, without reusing old accounts
- A terminated user is disabled across email, devices, and SaaS in minutes
- Privileged access is limited and reviewed, with strong authentication
- Backups are tested, documented, and tied to a recovery plan
- Security events are triaged, with clear next actions and timelines

## What we focus on first

We prioritize controls that protect identity and limit blast radius:

1. MFA enforcement and conditional access
2. Endpoint baseline and patching discipline
3. Backup verification and recovery runbooks
4. Logging and alert ownership for meaningful events

## FAQs

### Do you offer managed detection and response?

Yes. For clients that need deeper monitoring and response, we provide managed cybersecurity options that include endpoint detection, alert triage, and guided remediation.

### Can you align controls to insurance requirements?

We can help you translate common cybersecurity insurance questions into concrete controls, evidence, and an operating rhythm that you can maintain.

### How do you handle users who travel or work remote?

We design identity and device controls that stay consistent offsite, using conditional access, device compliance, and least privilege.
