## Why insurance conversations often stall

Cybersecurity insurance applications frequently ask for the same outcomes: MFA, backups, patching, EDR, access control, and incident response readiness. The problem is that many environments have partial coverage with weak evidence.

We help by turning the questions into:

- A list of controls that can be verified
- A short evidence plan for each control
- A process that keeps those controls maintained over time

## Where this matters in Las Vegas

Las Vegas businesses often rely on third-party vendors, seasonal staffing, and multi-site access. Those factors affect insurance readiness because they affect who has access and how quickly changes happen.

Examples that typically need extra attention:

- Contractor accounts that should be time-limited and reviewed
- Shared devices that require stronger session and access controls
- After-hours incident response expectations for customer-facing operations

## Common mistakes

- Answering "yes" to MFA while allowing legacy sign-in paths
- Listing backups without proving a restore for a critical system
- Saying devices are patched without a consistent patch policy and reporting
- Having an incident plan that exists, but no one has tested it

## What good looks like

Insurance readiness is sustainable when:

- Controls are implemented in a measurable way
- Evidence is easy to produce without last-minute scrambling
- Responsibility for each control is assigned and reviewed
- Exceptions are documented with risk acceptance and timelines

## FAQs

### Can you fill out an application for us?

We can support the process with documentation and validation, but your insurer may require that certain answers come from an officer of the company.

### Will this guarantee coverage?

No. Coverage depends on the policy, underwriting, and the insurer's decisions. The goal is to improve control quality and reduce the chance of claim-triggering events.

### Do you help after an incident?

We can help with incident containment and recovery planning. For legal or policy-specific guidance, we recommend involving your insurance broker and counsel.
