## What is included in an email migration

Email migration is more than copying mailboxes. A complete migration plan usually includes:

- Current-state discovery of domains, mail flow, and sender systems
- Shared mailbox and delegation mapping
- Archive, retention, and legal hold considerations when applicable
- DNS changes and validation steps for inbound and outbound mail
- User support for desktop and mobile reconfiguration

## Where this matters in Las Vegas

Las Vegas organizations often have after-hours communication needs and vendor-driven systems that send email. That makes it important to identify:

- Line-of-business systems that rely on SMTP or relay settings
- Multi-location users who may have different devices and network paths
- Cutover windows that match peak operational periods

## Common mistakes

- Not inventorying shared mailbox usage and delegated access
- Forgetting scanners and applications that send email
- Running a cutover without a pilot group that includes mobile users
- Treating user support as optional during the first days after migration

## What good looks like

You should see:

- A written cutover runbook with timing, owners, and validation steps
- A test plan that confirms mail flow for real business sender types
- Documented rollback triggers and an agreed backout approach
- Support coverage for the first week of real-world usage

## FAQs

### Can you migrate from Google Workspace?

Yes. The biggest risks are identity, permissions, and workflow changes, not only data transfer. We plan for those alongside mailbox moves.

### Do you migrate shared mailboxes and calendars?

Yes. Shared mailboxes, calendar permissions, and delegation are planned and tested so user experience does not degrade after cutover.

### Can you migrate in phases?

Yes. Phased migrations can reduce risk. We choose phases based on dependencies and user impact.
