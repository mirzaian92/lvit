## What backup and disaster recovery should accomplish

The goal is simple: recover the right systems in the right order within a timeframe your business can tolerate. That requires more than a backup job.

We typically cover:

- Backup design (what, how often, and where it is stored)
- Restore validation (proof that restores work, not assumptions)
- Disaster recovery runbooks (step-by-step recovery order and ownership)
- Recovery exercises that expose gaps before an incident does

## Where this matters in Las Vegas

Many Las Vegas organizations cannot tolerate long downtime windows, especially when operations are customer-facing or run past normal hours. Recovery planning should account for:

- After-hours response and who can approve recovery actions
- Multi-location dependencies, including ISP and VoIP impacts
- Physical device replacement timelines when onsite work is required

## Common mistakes

- Backups configured with no regular restore tests
- No separation between production and backup credentials
- Assuming cloud apps remove the need for backup verification
- Not documenting recovery order, which causes delays during incidents

## What good looks like

You should be able to say:

- Which systems are most critical and their recovery targets
- How long restores take in practice, not in theory
- Who performs each step and how access is granted during an incident
- What "done" looks like for recovery validation

## FAQs

### Do you back up Microsoft 365 data?

Microsoft 365 includes resilience, but it does not remove the need for recovery planning. We discuss retention, deletion scenarios, and what level of protection matches your risk.

### Is disaster recovery only for ransomware?

No. Recovery planning also covers hardware failure, accidental deletion, misconfiguration, and vendor outages.

### Can we do a tabletop exercise?

Yes. Tabletop exercises are a practical way to validate runbooks and decision points without a full disruption.
