## What Hardware as a Service is designed to solve

If every laptop is different, support becomes slower and security becomes inconsistent. A managed hardware program helps standardize:

- Approved device models per role
- Baseline build and security configuration
- Replacement cadence and warranty handling
- Device swaps that minimize downtime

## Where this matters in Las Vegas

Las Vegas teams often scale up quickly for new locations or seasonal needs. Standardized device programs help you onboard faster and reduce onsite disruption when devices fail.

We plan for:

- Device delivery timing across the valley
- After-hours swaps for customer-facing operations
- Consistent configuration for shared device roles

## Common mistakes

- Buying devices based on availability, then supporting a mixed fleet forever
- Skipping encryption and baseline controls during rush onboarding
- No spare device plan, causing long downtime during failures
- Not aligning device procurement with identity and access standards

## What good looks like

A healthy hardware program has:

- A small, approved catalog tied to job roles
- Standard imaging or provisioning with documented settings
- A plan for spares and rapid swaps
- Clear ownership for warranty and replacement processes

## FAQs

### Do we have to lease devices?

Not necessarily. The goal is standardization and lifecycle planning. The financial approach depends on your accounting preferences and operational needs.

### Can this include mobile devices?

It can. Mobile device management and procurement can be included when it improves security and reduces support time.

### Does this include IT disposal?

Yes, it can. Secure retirement of devices is part of a complete lifecycle process.
