## What we manage in a cloud environment

Managed cloud services focus on the operational layer:

- Identity and role management for cloud access
- Patch and configuration standards for cloud-hosted systems
- Monitoring, logging, and alert ownership
- Change control and rollback planning

## Where this matters in Las Vegas

If your business runs across multiple sites or across extended hours, cloud issues can become customer-facing quickly. Managed cloud services reduce the risk of unplanned changes and unclear responsibility.

We often support:

- Centralized access patterns for multi-location teams
- Vendor access with least privilege and time limits
- Documentation for how to restore service when a cloud dependency fails

## Common mistakes

- No consistent admin role strategy, leading to over-privileged accounts
- Logging enabled but not retained or reviewed, limiting investigation capability
- Changes made directly in production with no record and no rollback
- Cloud costs growing because ownership and tagging are unclear

## What good looks like

Healthy cloud operations show up as:

- A clear map of subscriptions, resources, and ownership
- Consistent access control and periodic review
- Alerts that result in remediation, not inbox fatigue
- Change records that explain what was done and why

## FAQs

### Is this separate from cloud migration?

Yes. Migration gets you there. Managed cloud services keep the environment stable after the move and reduce long-term operational risk.

### Do you support Microsoft Azure specifically?

Yes. Azure is a common platform in Las Vegas environments, especially when paired with Microsoft 365 identity and device controls.

### Can you provide reporting?

Yes. Reporting is designed to be useful: trends, repeated issues, and decisions needed from leadership.
