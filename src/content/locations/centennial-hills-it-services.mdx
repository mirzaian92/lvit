## Centennial Hills coverage is about response predictability

Northwest valley operations often include office suites, service businesses, and teams that travel between sites. The support plan should reduce repeat issues and keep onsite response realistic when physical work is required.

## Street and route context for onsite support

We plan around W Ann Road, N Durango Drive, N Buffalo Drive, and W Deer Springs Way. Major access routes commonly use US 95 and I-215 to move between the northwest valley and other business corridors.

## Local landmarks and hubs

We account for traffic and access patterns near Centennial Hills Park, the Providence area, and nearby hubs like Floyd Lamb Park at Tule Springs. These landmarks influence the best times for onsite visits and maintenance windows.

## What we handle most here

- Managed IT services for small and mid-sized businesses with multi-site needs
- Cybersecurity basics with identity hardening and endpoint standards
- Help desk support that focuses on root cause trends and documentation
- Backup and disaster recovery validation for core business systems
- Onsite Wi-Fi troubleshooting and access point placement improvements

## Northwest growth means more devices and more access changes

As teams grow, the risk is unmanaged drift: too many exceptions, too many admin accounts, and inconsistent device builds. In Centennial Hills, we focus on keeping the baseline tight so growth does not create a support backlog. That includes role-based access, standardized onboarding, and a clear process for approving changes that affect security or uptime.

## Area-specific onsite coverage explanation

For Centennial Hills clients, onsite is usually about speed and physical reality: device swaps, cabling, or access point work. We keep onsite efficient by:

- Using remote triage to identify the exact physical task
- Staging common spares for faster replacement
- Scheduling onsite around business hours while keeping 24 hours escalation for urgent outages
