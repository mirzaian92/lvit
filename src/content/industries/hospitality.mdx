## Hospitality IT is guest experience

When systems fail, it shows up immediately at the point of service. The IT plan needs to prioritize:

- Reliable networking and segmented Wi-Fi
- Support for POS, reservations, and back-office systems
- After-hours response when operations extend late or run 24 hours

## Systems we plan around

Hospitality environments commonly include:

- POS and payment workflows that depend on stable connectivity
- Guest and staff Wi-Fi with very different security requirements
- Phone systems and call routing for bookings and customer contact
- Vendor-supported systems with periodic maintenance access needs

## Security risks that matter here

Hospitality is a target for credential theft and disruptive incidents. Practical controls include:

- Separate networks for guest traffic, staff devices, and business systems
- MFA enforcement for email and administrative systems
- Patch discipline for endpoints and network devices
- Backup and recovery planning for business-critical systems

## Common mistakes

- One Wi-Fi network for everything, leading to avoidable exposure
- Devices unmanaged or shared, making offboarding incomplete
- Vendor access left open indefinitely
- No plan for how to operate when a system is down during peak hours

## What good looks like

Strong hospitality IT support has:

- Stable, monitored networking with clear segmentation
- Documentation for outage procedures and escalation paths
- Standards for devices that make swaps fast
- Reporting that reduces repeat issues rather than only reacting

## FAQs

### Do you support after-hours operations?

Yes. Hospitality frequently needs support outside typical business hours. We plan escalation and access so response is realistic.

### Can you help with guest Wi-Fi issues?

Yes. Guest Wi-Fi support starts with coverage and segmentation. We validate access points, signal quality, and capacity expectations.

### Do you coordinate with POS and reservation vendors?

Yes. We prefer documented escalation paths and controlled access so vendor support remains secure and trackable.
