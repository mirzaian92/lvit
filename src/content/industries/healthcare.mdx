## What makes healthcare IT different

Healthcare environments combine privacy requirements with uptime needs and a mix of clinical and administrative systems. The IT plan should support:

- Secure identity and access that is fast for staff and safe for patients
- Device standards and patching that do not break clinical workflows
- Backups and recovery planning with realistic restoration order

## Clinical workflows we plan around

Depending on specialty and size, you may have:

- EHR or practice management platforms
- Scheduling, patient messaging, and portals
- Imaging workflows and large file handling
- Shared workstations and devices used in clinical areas

The goal is stable access and predictable support, not constant change.

## Security and compliance considerations

HIPAA-related expectations often require safeguards around access, audit visibility, and data handling. Controls we prioritize:

- MFA enforcement and least privilege for administrative access
- Device encryption and standardized endpoint controls
- Safer sharing defaults and clear policies for external communication
- Documented incident response and recovery steps

## Common mistakes

- Shared accounts that make audit trails unreliable
- Exceptions for clinical workflows that are never revisited
- Backups that exist but have not restored an EHR-related dependency
- Vendor access that stays active with no review cadence

## What good looks like

Healthcare IT is healthier when:

- Access is role-based and changes are auditable
- Downtime procedures exist and are tested, even if they are simple
- Recovery targets are defined for key systems and validated
- Security controls are consistent across locations and devices

## FAQs

### Do you help with HIPAA-aligned IT controls?

Yes. We help implement technical safeguards and operational routines. Legal interpretations should come from counsel, but the controls and documentation can be built and maintained.

### Can you support multiple clinics or locations?

Yes. Multi-location healthcare is common in Las Vegas. We standardize device builds, access controls, and support intake to reduce variability.

### How do you handle after-hours incidents?

We plan escalation around patient care impact and operational schedules. After-hours readiness is part of the baseline planning.
