## What casino IT needs to protect

Casino environments can include many interconnected systems and stakeholders. The core goals are:

- Maintain uptime for guest-facing operations
- Control access across departments and vendors
- Prevent lateral movement through segmentation and least privilege

## Operational risks we focus on

Disruption tends to come from:

- Unplanned changes during busy periods
- Vendor access that bypasses normal controls
- Flat networks that allow broad impact from a single compromise
- Recovery plans that do not match real dependencies

## Security practices that matter most

Without claiming any specific compliance outcome, we focus on practical controls often expected in regulated or high-scrutiny environments:

- Named accounts, privileged role separation, and access reviews
- Centralized logging and meaningful alert ownership
- Network segmentation aligned to device classes and business functions
- Documented incident response and recovery playbooks

## Common mistakes

- Too many admin accounts with unclear purpose
- "Temporary" vendor access that becomes permanent
- Monitoring configured without a response loop
- Backups treated as insurance instead of tested recovery capability

## What good looks like

Casino IT operations improve when:

- Changes are planned, approved, and recorded
- Segmentation prevents one issue from spreading widely
- Response playbooks exist and are used
- Recovery steps are documented and tested in realistic order

## FAQs

### Can you support after-hours change windows?

Yes. Many casino environments rely on after-hours maintenance windows. We plan staffing and access so changes stay controlled.

### Do you coordinate with multiple vendors?

Yes. Multi-vendor coordination is common. We prefer time-limited access, logging, and a documented escalation model.

### Can you support co-managed operations?

Yes. Internal teams often own strategy and specialized systems, while the MSP supports baseline enforcement, monitoring, and escalation depth.
