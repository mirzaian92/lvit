## Engineering IT is a performance problem and a continuity problem

Engineering work commonly involves large files, specialized applications, and licensing that cannot be broken during updates. The IT plan has to keep:

- Workstations and drivers stable
- Storage fast and recoverable
- Remote access secure without slowing collaboration

## Systems we commonly see

Depending on discipline, engineering firms may use:

- CAD and modeling tools with license servers or cloud licensing
- High-performance workstations and multi-monitor setups
- Large file shares, project archives, and version control practices
- Remote access solutions for site visits and client meetings

## Security considerations that matter here

Engineering data can include sensitive building plans, infrastructure details, and client information. Risk patterns include:

- Credential compromise leading to access to project archives
- Vendor access that persists longer than intended
- Ransomware impact on file shares and project continuity

We focus on identity controls, least privilege, and tested recovery because those reduce impact when incidents occur.

## Common mistakes

- Patching workstations without a staged approach, breaking toolchains
- No documented storage tiering strategy, then performance degrades
- Backups that cannot restore large projects quickly enough to matter
- Remote access tools deployed without clear ownership and logging

## What good looks like

Engineering IT is healthy when:

- Workstations are standardized by role, with controlled updates
- Storage performance is measured and aligned to project needs
- Backups are tested with real project restore scenarios
- Remote access uses strong authentication and clear policy

## FAQs

### Can you support CAD workstations and licensing?

Yes. We plan around stability and performance, including staged patching and a documented approach to license dependencies.

### Do you support hybrid and remote work?

Yes. We focus on secure access patterns that do not require people to bypass controls to get their work done.

### Can you help reduce downtime during updates?

We use staged change control and testing. The goal is fewer surprises, not constant change.
