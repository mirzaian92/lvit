## Hospital IT needs a co-managed operating model

Hospitals typically have internal IT leadership and specialized systems. The MSP role is often coverage and depth:

- Standard endpoint and identity controls that remain enforceable
- Security monitoring and response support for meaningful events
- Backup and disaster recovery planning with tested procedures
- Documentation that supports audits and operational handoffs

## The systems that change the risk profile

Hospital environments often include:

- Clinical systems and specialized devices with vendor constraints
- Multi-department networks with different access needs
- Shared workstations and fast-paced user workflows
- Third-party integrations that require careful access boundaries

## Security and continuity priorities

What matters most is reducing blast radius and shortening incidents:

- Network segmentation for device classes and departments
- Named access, least privilege, and review cadences for privileged roles
- Documented incident response playbooks with after-hours authority
- Tested recovery runbooks for critical systems in the correct order

## Common mistakes

- Flat networks that allow lateral movement
- Vendor access left open permanently with no monitoring
- Recovery plans that exist on paper but are not validated in practice
- Change control bypassed under pressure, causing long-term drift

## What good looks like

Hospitals benefit from:

- Clear ownership between internal teams, vendors, and the MSP
- Standard baselines that respect clinical constraints
- Regular recovery exercises that expose dependencies
- Reporting that highlights risk reduction and remaining gaps

## FAQs

### Do you support after-hours response?

Yes. Hospitals require defined escalation and authority outside normal schedules. We plan response roles and access in advance.

### Can you work with biomedical and specialized device vendors?

We can coordinate access and documentation. Vendor constraints are common, so we build segmentation and access controls around them.

### Do you help with audit preparation?

We support operational documentation and evidence gathering for IT controls. Formal compliance and legal interpretation should be handled by your compliance and legal teams.
