## The startup IT problem is avoiding early drift

Early decisions about accounts, devices, and tools create long-term consequences. Startups benefit from:

- A clear identity provider and MFA enforcement from day one
- Standard devices and onboarding routines
- A simple but real backup and recovery plan

## Workflows we plan around

Startups often rely on:

- Microsoft 365 or a similar collaboration suite
- Cloud-based applications with rapid changes and new integrations
- Contractor access for design, development, and finance work
- Remote and hybrid work patterns

## Security guardrails that still allow speed

Controls we recommend early:

- Named accounts for every person and contractor
- Least privilege and separate admin roles
- Device encryption and baseline patching
- Logging and ownership for high-value systems

## Common mistakes

- Shared credentials and unmanaged tools that make offboarding impossible
- No device standards, leading to support chaos when the team grows
- Cloud resources created with no ownership, then costs and risk drift
- Backups ignored because the business is "cloud-first"

## What good looks like

A startup IT foundation is strong when:

- Onboarding is repeatable and fast
- Access is controlled and can be removed quickly
- Cloud changes are tracked and recoverable
- The team can add tools without losing security visibility
