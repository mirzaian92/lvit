## The IT problems that stop production

Printing operations often have critical dependencies:

- Print servers and queues that must stay stable
- Design workstations and shared file access
- Specialized devices and vendor-managed systems

When one piece fails, the business impact is immediate.

## Systems and devices we plan around

Printing services environments may include:

- Production printers and finishing equipment with network dependencies
- Workstations with specific software and driver requirements
- Shared job folders and archives that must be available
- Shipping, invoicing, and customer communication systems

## Security and continuity priorities

Production environments benefit from:

- Network segmentation for production devices versus office IT
- Named access and least privilege for administrative changes
- Backups that can restore a specific job repository quickly
- Change control for drivers and updates that can break production

## Common mistakes

- Flat networks where one compromised endpoint can affect production
- Updates applied without testing, breaking drivers or workflows
- No documented restore procedure for job data and print servers
- Vendor access left open permanently with no tracking

## What good looks like

Reliable print operations have:

- Standard workstations and controlled updates
- Clear boundaries between production and office networks
- Recovery runbooks for print servers and job repositories
- Support processes that record root cause and reduce repeat downtime

## FAQs

### Can you support specialized production devices?

Often yes. We document constraints and build segmentation and access controls around vendor requirements.

### Do you provide onsite support?

Yes. Printing environments often require onsite coordination for networking, cabling, and device troubleshooting.

### Can you help with secure disposal of old equipment?

Yes. IT asset disposition and recycling can be part of the lifecycle plan, including secure handling and documentation.
