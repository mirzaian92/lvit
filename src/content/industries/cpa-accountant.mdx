## The accounting season reality

During peak season, small issues become major downtime. IT needs to keep:

- Email and document exchange reliable
- Account and MFA recovery fast and controlled
- Workstations stable and performance-ready

## Systems and workflows we plan around

CPA and accounting environments often include:

- Accounting and tax applications with strict update requirements
- Secure portals for client document exchange
- Scanning, PDF workflows, and e-signature tools
- Multi-factor login to multiple third-party platforms

## Security considerations

Client financial data is highly sensitive. Practical controls include:

- MFA enforcement and privileged role separation
- Encryption and device management for laptops
- Backups with tested restores for key repositories
- Clear rules for external sharing and retention

## Common mistakes

- Workstations updated randomly during peak season
- Shared logins for staff convenience, then offboarding gaps appear
- No plan for device failure, creating long downtime
- Backups assumed to work without testing a real restore

## What good looks like

Strong IT support for accounting firms includes:

- Staged updates planned around peak periods
- Standard device builds and fast replacement capability
- Secure client exchange workflows that staff can follow
- Recovery runbooks for the systems that drive billing and deliverables

## FAQs

### Can you help with seasonal staff onboarding?

Yes. We can build role-based access templates and device standards so onboarding is faster and offboarding is complete.

### Do you support remote work during peak season?

Yes. We design secure remote access patterns that keep performance stable while protecting sensitive data.

### Can you coordinate with software vendors?

Yes. Vendor coordination is common. We prefer documented escalation paths and time-limited access where possible.
