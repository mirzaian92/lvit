## Nonprofit IT is usually a bandwidth problem

Many nonprofits rely on a small admin team and a mix of staff and volunteers. That creates predictable challenges:

- Account access changes that happen frequently
- Devices that are donated or inconsistent
- Data that must stay protected even with rotating personnel

## Systems and workflows we plan around

Nonprofits often use:

- Microsoft 365 for communication and document management
- Donor management or membership systems
- Shared mailboxes for programs and events
- Remote work tools for distributed teams

## Security priorities for nonprofits

Phishing and account compromise are common risks. High-value controls include:

- MFA enforcement and safer sign-in policies
- Role-based access and clear offboarding routines
- Device standards and encryption
- Backup verification for critical repositories

## Common mistakes

- Shared accounts for volunteers or seasonal staff
- No documentation of who has access to donor data
- Old devices used without management, increasing support and security risk
- Assuming cloud tools remove the need for recovery planning

## What good looks like

Nonprofit IT works best when:

- Access is easy to grant and remove, with audit clarity
- Devices are standardized enough to support quickly
- Security controls are consistent across staff and leadership
- The support model fits the team's reality without extra complexity

## FAQs

### Can you support nonprofit Microsoft licensing programs?

We can help align licensing to roles and required features. Eligibility and program rules depend on Microsoft and your organization.

### Do you support volunteer access?

Yes. We prefer time-limited access, least privilege, and clear rules for what data volunteers can access.

### Can you help with basic IT documentation?

Yes. Documentation is often the fastest way to reduce recurring problems and reliance on one person.
