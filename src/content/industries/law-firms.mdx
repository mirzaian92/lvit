## How IT shows up in a law firm day

Most legal work is deadlines plus documents plus client communication. IT needs to keep those three stable:

- Email and calendaring that stays reliable under pressure
- Document storage and sharing that supports version control and audit trails
- Secure remote access for court, travel, and after-hours work

## Systems and workflows we plan around

Law firms commonly rely on combinations of:

- Practice management and timekeeping platforms
- PDF creation, scanning, and e-signature workflows
- Shared mailboxes and delegation for assistants and paralegals
- Client portals or secure file transfer for sensitive materials

The IT plan should match how documents move from intake to filing to archive.

## Security and compliance considerations

Legal confidentiality is a business requirement, even when it is not a named regulation. Common risk areas:

- Phishing that targets wire instructions and account changes
- Over-permissioned file shares where older matters remain accessible
- Vendor access for e-discovery or specialized applications
- Lost devices containing local copies of sensitive documents

We prioritize identity controls, least privilege, and recoverability because those reduce impact when something goes wrong.

## Common failure modes

- One shared admin credential for multiple people
- MFA enabled but not consistently enforced for privileged access
- No clear rule for what must be stored in a managed location versus local desktops
- Backups that exist but have never restored a matter workspace under time pressure

## What a solid MSP plan looks like for law firms

The goal is to keep legal work moving while improving control and audit clarity:

- Standard device builds and predictable application sets per role
- External sharing defaults that are safe, with exceptions documented per matter
- A clear onboarding and offboarding process that protects client data
- Recovery runbooks that prioritize the systems lawyers actually need first

## FAQs

### Can you help with secure client file sharing?

Yes. We design sharing patterns that are easy for staff to follow and easy to audit, using role-based access and safer defaults.

### Do you support after-hours work?

Yes. Many firms need support outside typical office hours. We plan escalation and access so urgent work does not depend on one person being available.

### Can you reduce wire fraud risk?

We help reduce risk with identity controls, mailbox rule monitoring, and practical workflows that require verification for sensitive changes.
