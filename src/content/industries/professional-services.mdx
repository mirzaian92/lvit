## The workflows that create most IT tickets

Professional services is often a blend of client communication, document exchange, and billing. The tickets usually come from:

- Account and access issues that block client work
- File sharing confusion and permissions drift
- Device problems during travel or at client sites
- Email and calendar issues that disrupt scheduling

## Systems we plan around

Common systems include:

- Microsoft 365 for email, Teams, and file sharing
- CRM or engagement systems for client tracking
- Accounting and billing platforms
- Secure file transfer or portals for sensitive information

The MSP plan should keep these predictable, not fragile.

## Security risks that matter here

Professional services firms are attractive targets for phishing and impersonation because they exchange sensitive information. Controls that reduce practical risk:

- MFA enforcement and conditional access
- Admin role separation and access reviews
- Backups and recovery planning for key repositories
- Standard device baselines with encryption and patching

## Common mistakes

- Using personal devices and unmanaged apps without a clear policy
- Allowing broad external sharing without ownership or review
- Treating backups as a checkbox instead of testing restores
- Letting exceptions accumulate until standards no longer exist

## What good looks like

A strong operational setup has:

- Role-based access that is easy to manage and audit
- Clear client sharing patterns with safer defaults
- Support processes that capture context and reduce repeat issues
- Reporting that shows trends and decisions needed from leadership

## FAQs

### Can you support client site work and travel?

Yes. We design identity and device controls that work offsite without forcing users to bypass security to get work done.

### Do you help with Microsoft 365 governance?

Yes. We help define sharing defaults, admin roles, and operational routines so Microsoft 365 stays manageable as the firm grows.

### Can we keep some IT tasks internal?

Yes. Many firms choose a co-managed model where internal staff own certain systems while the MSP provides coverage, escalation, and standards.
