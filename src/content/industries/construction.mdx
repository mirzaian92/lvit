## What breaks most often in construction environments

The biggest disruptions are usually access and coordination problems:

- Crews cannot reach plan sets or RFIs in the field
- Mobile devices fail or lose sign-in access
- Vendor accounts and shared links get out of control
- A ransomware event stops the office from billing and managing schedules

## Workflows and systems we plan around

Construction teams often use:

- Project management platforms and shared plan repositories
- Field tablets and phones used on cellular and Wi-Fi
- Shared mailboxes for bids, permits, and vendor coordination
- File sharing with subcontractors and owners

IT should support predictable access without opening the environment to unnecessary risk.

## Where security matters in construction

Construction environments often have many external parties and changing access needs. That increases:

- Risk from credential reuse and shared logins
- Exposure from overly broad external sharing
- Device loss risk due to mobile hardware in the field

Controls that help most are MFA enforcement, device management, and clear vendor access boundaries.

## Common mistakes

- One Wi-Fi network for everything, including guest and job site devices
- No standard for device setup, which slows down replacement and support
- External sharing enabled everywhere, then cleaned up only after a scare
- Backups designed for file servers only, ignoring SaaS dependencies

## What good looks like

A strong IT plan for construction has:

- A documented job site connectivity approach and escalation path
- Standard device roles with fast replacement and secure sign-in
- Vendor access that is time-limited and reviewed
- Recovery steps that prioritize scheduling, accounting, and plan access

## FAQs

### Can you support multiple job sites at once?

Yes. We design standards that scale across sites, including how devices are configured and how access is granted to project data.

### Do you help with job site networking?

Yes. We can help plan and support Wi-Fi and connectivity so field teams can reliably access required systems.

### What about subcontractor access?

We prefer controlled sharing and least-privilege access with expiration. That reduces risk while keeping collaboration practical.
