## Hotel IT is a service reliability problem

Hotels need reliability across many systems:

- Guest Wi-Fi and staff networks
- Front desk and operations workflows
- Phones and communication systems
- Vendor-managed tools that require controlled access

## Systems and workflows we plan around

Hotels often have:

- Property management and reservation systems
- Shared workstations at the front desk
- Back-office accounting and HR systems
- Onsite events and conference connectivity needs

## Security priorities

Practical controls that reduce risk:

- Segmented networks for guest traffic, staff devices, and business systems
- Named access and least privilege for administrative changes
- MFA enforcement for email and critical portals
- Recovery planning for guest-impacting dependencies

## Common mistakes

- Guest and staff devices sharing network paths
- Shared credentials for front-desk roles with incomplete offboarding
- Vendor access not reviewed or time-limited
- No documented outage procedures for key systems during busy periods

## What good looks like

Hotel IT improves when:

- Networks are segmented and monitored
- Device standards make swaps fast and predictable
- Support procedures reduce repeat issues
- Recovery steps are documented and tested for critical workflows

## FAQs

### Can you support event and conference network needs?

Yes. Events can create spikes in demand and complexity. We plan segmentation and capacity so guest experience remains consistent.

### Do you support VoIP phones?

Yes. Phone reliability matters for bookings and guest support. We plan VoIP around network readiness and failover behavior.

### Do you provide onsite support?

Yes. Hotels often require onsite coordination due to building access, cabling, and device replacement needs.
