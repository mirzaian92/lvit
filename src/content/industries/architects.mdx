## The architecture workflow that drives IT requirements

Architecture work is iterative and collaborative. IT has to support:

- Large file transfers and version clarity
- Reviews with clients and contractors
- Mixed device use: office workstations, laptops, and site-visit devices

## What we plan around

Common needs include:

- Workstation standards by role, including graphics performance needs
- Project folder structures and access models that reflect real teams
- External sharing patterns that are safe by default, not improvised
- Backup and recovery for both active projects and archived work

## Where security matters

Architecture firms often share files externally. The risk is not sharing itself. The risk is uncontrolled sharing without expiration, ownership, or audit visibility.

We focus on:

- Identity hardening and safer sharing defaults
- Least privilege for project archives
- Recovery planning for critical project repositories

## Common mistakes

- Everyone has access to every project, then access is never reviewed
- File shares grow without ownership, then restores become slow and expensive
- Workstations are patched inconsistently, breaking performance-sensitive tools
- Vendor accounts stay active after a project ends

## What good looks like

Good architecture IT operations have:

- Standard workstation builds and controlled update cycles
- A clear sharing model for clients and subcontractors
- Documented backup and restore steps for a specific project archive
- A predictable support process for printing, plotters, and file issues

## FAQs

### Can you help with plotters and large format printing?

Yes. Printing is often business-critical for design reviews. We support printer workflows and reduce repeat issues through standardization.

### Do you support teams in multiple offices?

Yes. Multi-site file access and identity controls are common. We design access patterns that stay secure and usable.

### Can you support seasonal project spikes?

Yes. We plan for onboarding, access, and device readiness so spikes do not turn into security gaps.
