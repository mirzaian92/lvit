## Logistics IT is a workflow continuity problem

Most logistics downtime is not a complex outage. It is a broken scanner, Wi-Fi dead zones, or access failures that stop receiving and fulfillment.

## Systems and workflows we plan around

Logistics environments often include:

- Warehouse Wi-Fi and segmented networks for device types
- Scanners, label printers, and shared workstations
- Dispatch, routing, and scheduling systems
- Vendor integrations and EDI-like workflows

## Security and operational risks

Practical risks include:

- Shared logins on warehouse devices that make offboarding incomplete
- Flat networks that allow broad impact from a single issue
- Backups that do not prioritize the systems needed to ship and receive
- Vendor access that is not time-limited and not documented

## Common mistakes

- Treating warehouse Wi-Fi like office Wi-Fi without coverage validation
- No spare device plan for scanners and label printers
- Changes made during peak periods without a rollback plan
- Not documenting outage procedures for core systems

## What good looks like

Logistics IT support is effective when:

- Wi-Fi coverage is tested and monitored, not assumed
- Device standards and spares reduce downtime from hardware failures
- Identity and access controls are consistent across sites and roles
- Recovery steps are documented for the systems that move product

## FAQs

### Can you support multiple warehouses or locations?

Yes. We standardize networks and device roles so support remains consistent across sites.

### Do you help with cloud-based logistics platforms?

Yes. We plan identity, access, and continuity for SaaS platforms and their integrations.

### Can you improve scanner and printing reliability?

Yes. We focus on Wi-Fi coverage, device standards, and proactive replacement planning to reduce recurring downtime.
