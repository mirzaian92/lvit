## What matters most in a med spa environment

The highest impact issues are usually customer-facing:

- Scheduling and intake system downtime
- Payment and device problems at the front desk
- Wi-Fi coverage problems that affect staff apps and guest experience

## Workflows we plan around

Medical spas commonly rely on:

- Scheduling and intake platforms
- POS and payment workflows that require stable networking
- Marketing systems and customer communication channels
- Multiple devices per role, including tablets and mobile devices

## Security and privacy considerations

Even when the environment is not a hospital, privacy expectations still matter. We focus on:

- Separate Wi-Fi networks for staff, guests, and business devices
- Device management and account hygiene for staff turnover
- MFA enforcement and safe access for vendors and contractors

## Common mistakes

- One network for everything, including guest devices
- Shared logins that make offboarding incomplete
- No device standards, causing frequent reconfiguration during turnover
- Not documenting how critical systems can be recovered quickly

## What good looks like

Good MSP support for med spas includes:

- Reliable networking with clear segmentation
- Standard device builds that speed up onboarding
- Microsoft 365 and identity controls that reduce phishing risk
- Backup and recovery planning for critical business systems

## FAQs

### Can you support multiple spa locations?

Yes. We standardize networks and devices across sites so issues are repeatable and faster to resolve.

### Do you help with VoIP and front desk phones?

Yes. Reliable phones matter for bookings and follow-up. We plan VoIP around network readiness and failover needs.

### Can you reduce downtime during busy periods?

We focus on stability and proactive monitoring. We also keep spares and documented swaps available when hardware failure would otherwise create long downtime.
