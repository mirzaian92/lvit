## Manufacturing IT is a reliability requirement

Manufacturing environments often include a mix of office IT and shop-floor devices. The priority is keeping operations running while reducing risk from lateral movement and unplanned changes.

## Systems and devices we plan around

Depending on the operation, you may have:

- ERP or inventory systems that drive purchasing and fulfillment
- Barcode scanners, label printers, and shared workstations
- Vendor-supported industrial software that requires remote access
- Networks that need clear segmentation for different device types

## Security and continuity risks

Risks that commonly cause real downtime:

- Flat networks that allow one compromised device to affect many systems
- Vendor access that is not time-limited or logged
- Backups that cannot restore the systems that actually run production
- Unsupported endpoints that cannot be patched but still require isolation

## Common mistakes

- Treating shop-floor devices like normal desktops, then breaking workflows
- Allowing shared logins, which makes access control and audits difficult
- Patching without coordination, causing downtime during critical windows
- No documented recovery order for production systems

## What good looks like

Healthy manufacturing IT has:

- Network segmentation that matches device risk and function
- Clear ownership of vendor access and remote support tooling
- Tested restores for the systems that run operations
- Device standards that reduce help desk time and security exceptions

## FAQs

### Can you support legacy or vendor-controlled systems?

Often yes. The key is documenting constraints and using segmentation and access controls to reduce risk when patching is limited.

### Do you support multi-shift operations?

Yes. We plan support and escalation around operational schedules, including after-hours response expectations.

### How do you approach downtime risk?

We prioritize stability, staged changes, and tested recovery so incidents are shorter and less disruptive.
