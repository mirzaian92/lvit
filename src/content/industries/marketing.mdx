## Marketing IT is collaboration plus performance

Most marketing teams need two outcomes at once:

- Devices and tools that stay fast for creative workflows
- Account and sharing controls that reduce security incidents

## Workflows we plan around

Marketing teams commonly rely on:

- Cloud storage and collaboration tools
- Frequent file sharing with clients and contractors
- Multiple devices and remote work patterns
- Analytics and ad platform access with shared responsibilities

## Security risks that appear most often

Marketing teams often have broad access to third-party platforms and external sharing. Common risks:

- Credential compromise for ad accounts and email
- Over-permissioned sharing links that remain active indefinitely
- Shadow tool adoption without ownership or offboarding routines

## Common mistakes

- Everyone uses their own tools with no documentation or admin ownership
- Shared credentials instead of named accounts with role-based access
- No device standards, leading to slow support and inconsistent security
- Backups ignored because "everything is in the cloud"

## What good looks like

A healthy marketing IT setup includes:

- Standard device builds and staged updates that respect creative tooling
- Role-based access to platforms and shared assets
- Sharing defaults that are safe, with exceptions documented
- Practical AI and automation guardrails that protect client data

## FAQs

### Can you support contractors and freelancers?

Yes. We prefer time-limited access, least privilege, and clear offboarding so contractor access does not become permanent.

### Do you help with AI tool governance?

Yes. We help define what data is allowed, which tools are approved, and how to keep usage safe and reviewable.

### Can you reduce account takeover risk?

We reduce risk with strong identity controls, role separation, and clear recovery processes for high-value accounts.
