## What medical practices need from IT support

Most practices need the same three outcomes:

1. Reliable access to scheduling and practice systems
2. Secure handling of patient information
3. Rapid recovery when a device or account blocks care

## Office workflows that drive the support plan

Common workflows include:

- Appointment scheduling and reminders
- Patient forms, scanning, and document management
- Secure messaging with patients and referrals
- Billing coordination and insurance documentation

The IT plan should reduce login friction while keeping audit visibility intact.

## Security controls that tend to matter most

For many practices, the most impactful controls are also the most practical:

- MFA enforcement and account recovery processes
- Managed devices with encryption and consistent patching
- Least privilege and separate admin accounts
- Backup validation for key data stores and file repositories

## Common mistakes

- Using shared accounts for convenience, then losing audit clarity
- Keeping old vendor accounts active after a change or project
- Relying on one workstation that becomes a single point of failure
- Not documenting what to do when the practice system is unavailable

## What good looks like

You should be able to:

- Disable a compromised account quickly and restore access safely
- Replace a failed device without rebuilding from scratch
- Identify who has access to patient-facing systems and why
- Restore critical data in a predictable order

## FAQs

### Can you support HIPAA-related requirements?

Yes. We implement technical controls and routines that support privacy expectations. Specific compliance interpretation should be handled with counsel.

### Do you provide onsite support?

Yes, when onsite is the fastest way to restore operations, such as device swaps, network issues, or physical access constraints.

### Can you coordinate with our EHR vendor?

Yes. Vendor coordination is common. We prefer documented escalation paths and time-limited access so support stays controlled.
