## Real estate IT is identity plus communication

The biggest business risks are often email compromise and workflow confusion around sensitive changes. A strong IT plan supports:

- Secure email and account recovery
- Mobile device reliability for agents and remote staff
- File sharing and document signature workflows

## Workflows that drive support needs

Real estate teams commonly handle:

- Transaction documents shared with multiple external parties
- Rapid onboarding and offboarding of agents and contractors
- Shared mailboxes, forwarding rules, and delegated access
- Devices used across multiple networks and locations

## Security risks to prioritize

Wire fraud and impersonation attempts are common themes. Controls that help most:

- Strong MFA enforcement and sign-in risk policies
- Mailbox rule monitoring and safer external sharing defaults
- Clear verification workflows for sensitive changes

## Common mistakes

- Shared logins for convenience, creating long-term risk
- External sharing that stays open and is not reviewed
- Devices without management controls, making loss and recovery harder
- No documented process for high-risk requests like payment instruction changes

## What good looks like

Good IT support for real estate includes:

- Standard device setups with fast replacement and secure sign-in
- A clear policy for sensitive requests and verification
- Access that can be removed quickly when an agent leaves
- Backup and recovery planning for key transaction repositories
