## What most SMBs need first

Before advanced projects, most SMBs benefit from the basics done consistently:

- Identity and MFA enforcement
- Standard devices and patching discipline
- Backups with proven restores
- A help desk that reduces repeat issues over time

## How we scope an SMB environment

We start with clarity:

- Which systems are business-critical
- Which users need elevated access and why
- Where data lives and how it can be recovered
- What vendors have access and how that access is controlled

## Security priorities that reduce real risk

SMBs are targeted because controls are often inconsistent. High-value controls include:

- Separate admin accounts and least privilege
- Conditional access and safer sharing defaults
- Endpoint encryption and standardized configurations
- Documented incident response and recovery basics

## Common mistakes

- Relying on one person who knows everything, with no documentation
- Buying tools without defining who owns monitoring and response
- Letting device standards drift until support slows down
- Treating backups as a checkbox and never testing restores

## What good looks like

SMB IT is healthier when:

- Support is predictable and measurable
- Standards reduce chaos and onboarding becomes faster
- Security is practical and enforced, not optional
- Recovery steps are written and tested for the systems that matter

## FAQs

### Do you support onsite work?

Yes. Onsite is used when it reduces downtime or when physical changes are needed. Most issues are handled remotely first.

### Can you help us transition from break-fix IT?

Yes. We move from reactive support to standards, monitoring, and documented operations so problems reduce over time.

### Do you provide 24 hours coverage?

Yes. Coverage is planned around business impact and operational schedules, including after-hours escalation when required.
