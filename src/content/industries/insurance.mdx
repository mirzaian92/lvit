## The daily IT needs in insurance operations

Insurance work depends on secure communication and consistent portal access. Most disruption comes from:

- Account lockouts and MFA issues
- Email compromise risk and impersonation attempts
- Document workflows and client data handling confusion

## Systems and workflows we plan around

Insurance environments commonly include:

- Microsoft 365 for email and collaboration
- Carrier portals and web-based quoting systems
- Document repositories for policies, claims, and renewals
- Phones and call routing that must remain reliable during peak periods

## Security and regulatory considerations

Insurance teams handle personal information and financial details. Practical controls we prioritize:

- MFA enforcement and conditional access for sign-ins
- Named admin roles and least privilege
- Backup and recovery planning for critical business repositories
- Email security hardening and mailbox rule monitoring

## Common mistakes

- MFA enabled only for some accounts, leaving gaps for attackers
- Shared logins for portals, preventing safe offboarding
- External sharing without ownership and review
- No documented response plan for suspected email compromise

## What good looks like

Insurance IT is healthier when:

- Identity is protected and account recovery is fast and controlled
- Access to portals is role-based where possible
- Sensitive documents live in managed locations with clear permissions
- Recovery steps are documented and tested for critical workflows

## FAQs

### Can you help with cyber insurance readiness?

Yes. We can help implement and document controls that insurers commonly ask about, such as MFA, backups, patching, and endpoint protection.

### Do you support multi-location agencies?

Yes. We standardize device and access controls across offices so support is consistent and security does not drift.

### Can you reduce phishing risk?

We reduce risk through layered controls: identity hardening, mail flow configuration, and user-focused guidance tied to real examples.
